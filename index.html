      Welcome to "Escape the Dragon"! You must escape the dragon that has kidnapped you. You are in the dragon's lair. You have no armor, no weapons, no magic. Your only option is to flee. There seems to be an opening to the east. To the south you spot some glinting light and to the west you see a rock wall with what appears to be hand holds. Where do you want to go? Use the buttons above.
