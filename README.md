# the-cave
The one, the only (maybe), the first game I tried to code in JS....The Cave!

This project was designed to test my knowledge and skill with javascript at an intermeadiate level. See "Escape The Dragon" for the beginner level game.  
There are no current plans for a hard project as I don't know what skills I'm missing to use in the hard project.
